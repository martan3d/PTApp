# PTApp
Refactor of PTReceiver - Android App to program PT and PT receiver - Python Beeware

Only the changed files are here, all others are generated by briefcase and beeware, see the documentation to build a hello world app, then add this app.py, the toml file and the xbee.py file
This is an android only app, I already have an app for windows so it seemed redundant to port this to two platforms.

This program REQUIRES a USB Xbee 'dongle' device to talk to the Protothrottle and your android device must support OTG on the USB port. The dongle MUST use the Silicon Labs CP210x chipset. The dongle H/W can be found on Amazon, search for 'WaveShare Xbee'.

The Xbee chip for this can be ordered from Sparkfun.com.

You will also need the XCTU program from the Xbee manufacturer, Digi, it's free. If you want to play with around with Xbees, this program is essential.

As far as configuration, the Xbee must have the 802.15.4 TH firmware installed, many are shipped with the Digimesh firmware, that won't work. XCTU will let you install the latest if needed using the 'update' button at the top. Once the firmware is verified, you have to change a few configuration items in the chip. Set the ID Network PAN ID to 225. Find the API Enable and set it to API Mode without Escapes (1). Just below that, find the baud rate and set it to 38400. Everything else you can leave at the defaults.
